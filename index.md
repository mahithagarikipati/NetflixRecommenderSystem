### Context & Motivation
The context for this project is to implement a recommender system that predicts movies for Netflix platform. 

In today’s world, it is important to recommend items based on users preference due to many competitors in the world’s market. 

With the global pandemic taking a toll, the number of people who subscribed for Netflix and other streaming platforms rose as it became the prime means of entertainment. 

Netflix, itself started publishing new content everyday along with other competitors and as a result, users often get confused and frustrated with the huge ocean of available content. 

This makes the project really important, since it recommends movies based on user’s preference which is the most leading factor amongst many streaming competitors and helps us to learn about algorithm implementations more in detail. 

### Steps Implemented

### Datasets

The dataset that is to be implemented in this project will be MovieLens 20M dataset provided by Kaggle. 

The link to this dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)

The size of the data is around 693 MB and contains details about the user id, movie id, ratings, timestamp, movie title, year of movie release, genres. 

This dataset contains around 20 Million ratings on 27 thousand movies which are given by 138 thousand users. 

### Understanding of Algorithms:

#### Recommender Systems

The main role of Recommender Systems is to recommend items to the user. 

The items recommended can be based on the previous items liked by the user or based on other users with similar preferences.

This classifies the recommnder systems into 2 types - Collaborative Recommender Systems & Content Based Recommender Systems.

#### Collaborative Recommender Systems:

In this type of Recommender Systems, recommendations are made to user by collecting the data of users having similar preferences and taste.

When applied to this project, it recommends movies to a user based on the ratings of other users with similar preference.

In this project we use Pearson Correlation to recommend top 15 movies to the given user.

#### Content Recommender Systems:

In this type of Recommender Systems, recommendations are made to the user based on the user's preferences in the past.

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient:

The extent to which two sets of data are related is measured by correlation. 
The most common measure of correlation in statistics is the Pearson Correlation. 
The Pearson Product Moment Correlation is its full name (PPMC). It shows the relationship between two sets of data in a linear way.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95369639/145697582-5ee562d1-9a42-4303-a1ca-d6e3a4e1b6af.png)

We calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and therefore similarity among users based on the movies they saw and provided similar ratings to reach at movie recommendation as an outcomes.

##### Interpreting Pearson Correlation
1.-1 indicates that two users are behaving in radically opposing ways.
2.There is no relationship between 0 and 1.
3.1 indicates that two users have identical behaviors.

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between two variables can be found by dividing the covariance of the variables by the product of their standard deviations in statistics.

#### Alternating Least Squares
The Alternating Least Square (ALS) algorithm is a matrix factorization approach which runs in parallel. 
ALS is built for large-scale collaborative filtering tasks and is implemented in Apache Spark ML. 
ALS does a decent job of dealing with the Ratings data's scalability and sparseness, and it's simple and scales well to very big datasets.
We use Matrix Factorization to deconstruct the user-item matrix into a lower-dimensional matrix comprising user factors and item factors.

##### Our work flow is following:
1. When a new user enters their favourite movies, the system generates new user-movie interaction samples for the model.
2. With the new inputs, the system retrains the ALS model on data.
3. For inference, the system generates movie data (in our case,  we sample all movies from the data)
4. According to the ranking of movie rating predictions, the system generates the top N movie recommendations for that user.

By minimizing the cost function, these smaller dimension matrices are used to estimate the ratings.
Ratings are predicted and given as results after numerous iterations of lowering the Root Mean Square Error at the convergence point.

#### Cosine Similarity:
The cosine of the angle between two vectors projected into multidimensional space is used to compute cosine similarity between two vectors. 
That can be used on items in a dataset to determine how similar they are to one another utilizing keywords or other criteria. 
The dot product of two vectors (A and B) is divided by the reported to be significantly to calculate the similarity between them, as indicated in the equation below. 
Simply put, as the angle between two vectors lowers, the CS score of the two vectors increases.

###  About our modified dataset:

Due to the difficulty in computing the ( 20 Million ratings * 27 thousand movies) using dsba-hadoop cluster, the amount of data is reduced

The number of movies originally contains data from (1995 - 2015). 

However, for this project, only 3 year movies are considered (2013 - 2015) and their corresponding users and ratings.

Total number of movies = 1878

Total number of ratings = 5112

A total of 397 users are considered for this Netflix Recommender System

SInce, the name of the user is not available in the dataset, user id is considered. The set of user id are as follows:

## Performance Evaluation

ALS, have been applied by splitting the data into 70-30% training and test data as well as 85-15% training and test data.

RMSE value, when considered 70,30 split percentage is 1.696 while for the 85,15 split is 1.656.

Clearly from the above outputs, the recommendations when made for each user, using pearson and cosine are only around 40% common.

Evaluating these results by considering the recommendations from ALS, Pearson correlation and cosine similarity for a random user among the above 10.

The top 10 ALS recommendations, have some recommendations common with Pearson correlation recommendations


## What we accomplished?

In our project proposal, we planned to develop a hybrid movie recommender system for Netflix platform based on the MovieLens 20M dataset, that can be implemented on distributed systems using spark.
- (a) definitely will do - Collaborative filtering using Pearson Correlation Algorithm
- (b) likely will do - Comparing the Pearson correlation result with cosine similarity 
- (c) would ideally like to do items - Content based filtering and Integrating the both filtering to make a hybrid recommendation system

We accomplished both (a) & (b). We implemented collaborative filtering using pearson correlation and compared with cosine similarity. 

Additionally we used ALS to train model and to calculate Root Mean Square Error value

## Comments & Observations

- Having never worked with spark, it was challange to learn how to integrate it with Google Colab platform.
- As the initial data is vast, when we tried running it on dsba-hadoop cluster, it took more than a day to run the pearson correlation, after which vpn connection got terminated.
- Reducing the dataset, has made the recommendations bit easier, however the cluster still took a little more than an hour to give recommendations. 
- Running the dsba-cluster for both pearson correlation and cosine similarity to test was a bit time consuming.
- We were surprised to find the recommendations made by both pearson and cosine, have very less similarity. For the random users tested, to get top 15 recommendations, atmost only 6-7 recommendations are same.
- We got to know how to use spark in regular python code and how to use map, filter, show commands using spark
- Also, this project made it easier, when studying for final - Recommender systems & spark topic
